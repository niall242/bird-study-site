        <h2>The Centrala Tweet Club</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome citizens of Centrala! This website has been developed with the goal to learn more about our local birds. 
            How many migrant birds do we see each year? What are their favourite places to hang out? Whats' the rarest bird 
            you have seen? We encourage every local resident to post their observations on this forum along with a picture 
            if you can. This website is a collaboration of the CEA and the CTO - their aim is to encourage more wildlife in 
            the area. They will take your opinions and use them for conservation and to help develop some great new green 
            spaces in Centrala and the surrounding area. It doesn't matter how mundane your comment is or how blurry the 
            picture is, we would love to hear what you have to say. And, of course, there's nothing stopping you from making 
            a friend or two along the way :) We can all benefit from the social creatures that tweet around us üê¶
